b2IDE is a set of 
Flash AS3 components for rapidly building and prototyping Box2D physics simulations.

Please note that b2IDE is made to run alongside the excellent Box2D physics engine. b2IDE does nothing without Box2D!

Beware of bugs! This initial release has not been tested by anyone but me yet.

More generally, please submit any and all feedback, bugs, and comments.
The idea behind b2IDE is to speed up people's work, so if b2IDE doesn't do that, 
but could if only it had some changes, then I'd love to hear about it. 
Feel free to open an issue on the project page. I'll also make a thread about b2IDE on the 
Box2DFlash forum: http://www.box2d.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=8

If you make anything awesome with b2IDE, I'd love to hear about it!

regards,
