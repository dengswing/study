/**
 * 	TimelineLite is a lightweight, intuitive timeline class for building and managing sequences of 
 * 	TweenLite, TweenMax, TimelineLite, and/or TimelineMax instances. You can treat a TimelineLite 
 *  much like a MovieClip timeline in the Flash IDE. You can:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> build sequences easily by adding tweens with the append(), prepend(), and insert() methods.
 * 
 * 		<li> add labels, play(), stop(), gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), restart(), and even reverse()! 
 * 		
 * 		<li> nest timelines within timelines as deeply as you want. When you pause or change the 
 * 		  timeScale of a timeline, it affects all of its descendents.
 * 		  
 * 		<li> reverse() smoothly anytime. 
 * 		
 * 		<li> set the progress of the timeline using its "progress" property. For example, to skip to
 * 		  the halfway point, set myTimeline.progress = 0.5. 
 * 		  
 * 		<li> tween the "totalTime" or "progress" property to fastforward/rewind the timeline. You could 
 * 		  even attach a slider to one of these properties to give the user the ability to drag 
 * 		  forwards/backwards through the whole timeline.
 * 		
 * 		<li> speed up or slow down the entire timeline with its timeScale property. You can even tween
 * 		  this property to gradually speed up or slow down the timeline.
 * 		  
 * 		<li> add onComplete, onStart, onUpdate, and/or onReverseComplete callbacks using the constructor's "vars" object.
 * 		  
 * 		<li> use the insertMultiple() method to create complex sequences including various alignment
 * 		  modes and staggering capabilities. You can optionally use a new shorthand syntax too, 
 * 		  like "[mc, 1, {x:100}]" instead of "new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:100})". 
 * 		  
 * 		<li> base the timing on frames instead of seconds if you prefer. Please note, however, that
 * 		  the timeline's timing mode dictates its childrens' timing mode as well. 
 * 		
 * 		<li> kill the tweens of a particular object with killTweensOf() or get the tweens of an object
 * 		  with getTweensOf() or get all the tweens/timelines in the timeline with getChildren()
 * 		  
 * 		<li> If you need even more features like AS3 event listeners, repeat, repeatDelay, yoyo, 
 * 		  addCallback(), removeCallback(), getActive() and more, check out TimelineMax which extends TimelineLite.
 * 	</ul>
 * 	
 * <b>EXAMPLE:</b><br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		import gs.TweenLite;<br />
 * 		import gs.TimelineLite;<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//create the timeline<br />
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add a tween<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:200, y:100}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add another tween at the end of the timeline (makes sequencing easy)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc, 0.5, {alpha:0}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//reverse it anytime...<br />
 * 		myTimeline.reverse();<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//Add a "spin" label 3-seconds into the timeline.<br />
 * 		myTimeline.addLabel("spin", 3);<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//insert a rotation tween at the "spin" label (you could also define the insert point as the time instead of a label)<br />
 * 		myTimeline.insert(new TweenLite(mc, 2, {rotation:"360"}), "spin"); <br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//go to the "spin" label and play the timeline from there...<br />
 * 		myTimeline.gotoAndPlay("spin");<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//add a tween to the beginning of the timeline, pushing all the other existing tweens back in time<br />
 * 		myTimeline.prepend(new TweenLite(mc, 1, {tint:0xFF0000}));<br /><br />
 * 		
 * 		//nest another TimelineLite inside your timeline...<br />
 * 		var nestedTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite();<br />
 * 		nestedTimeline.append(new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {x:200}));<br />
 * 		myTimeline.append(nestedTimeline);<br /><br /></code>
 * 		
 * 		
 * 	insertMultiple() provides some very powerful sequencing tools, allowing you to add an Array of 
 * 	tweens (using TweenLite/Max instances or the new shorthand syntax, like <code>[mc, 1, {x:100}]</code>) and align them
 * 	as ALIGN_SEQUENCE or ALIGN_START or ALIGN_INIT, and even stagger them if you want. For example, to insert
 * 	3 tweens into the timeline, aligning their start times but staggering them by 0.2 seconds, <br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		myTimeline.insertMultiple([new TweenLite(mc, 1, {y:"100"}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc2, 1, {y:"100"}),
 * 								   new TweenLite(mc3, 1, {y:"100"})], 
 * 								   0, 
 * 								   TimelineLite.ALIGN_START, 
 * 								   0.2);</code><br /><br />
 * 								   
 * 	You can use the constructor's "vars" object to do virtually all the setup too, like this sequence:<br /><br /><code>
 * 	
 * 		var myTimeline:TimelineLite = new TimelineLite({tweens:[[mc1, 1, {y:"100"}], [mc2, 1, {y:"100"}], [mc3, 1, {y:"100"}]], align:TimelineLite.ALIGN_SEQUENCE, onComplete:myFunction});</code><br /><br />
 * 	
 * 	If that confuses you, don't worry. Just use the append(), insert(), and prepend() methods to build your
 * 	sequence. But power users will likely appreciate the quick, compact way they can set up sequences now. <br /><br />
 *  	
 * 	
 * <b>SPECIAL PROPERTIES THAT CAN BE PASSED IN VIA THE CONSTRUCTOR'S "VARS" OBJECT:</b>
 * 	<ul>
 * 	<li><b> delay : Number</b>			Amount of delay before the timeline should begin (in seconds unless "useFrames" is set 
 * 										to true in which case the value is measured in frames).
 * 
 *  <li><b> paused : Boolean</b> 		Sets the initial paused state of the timeline (by default, timelines automatically begin playing immediately)
 * 								
 * 	<li><b> useFrames : Boolean</b>		If useFrames is set to true, the timeline's timing mode will be based on frames. 
 * 										Otherwise, it will be based on seconds/time. NOTE: a TimelineLite's timing mode is 
 * 										always determined by its parent timeline. 
 * 
 *  <li><b> paused : Boolean</b>		If true, the timeline will be paused initially.
 * 
 * 	<li><b> reversed : Boolean</b>		If true, the timeline will be reversed initially. 
 * 									
 * 	<li><b> tweens : Array</b>			To immediately insert several tweens into the timeline, use the "tweens" special property
 * 										to pass in an Array of TweenLite or TweenMax instances, or use the shorthand syntax like
 * 										<code>[mc, 1, {x:100}]</code> instead of <code>new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:100})</code>. You can use this in conjunction
 * 										with the align and stagger special properties to set up complex sequences with minimal code.
 * 										These values simply get passed to the insertMultiple() method.
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> align : String</b>			Only used in conjunction with the "tweens" special property when multiple tweens are
 * 										to be inserted immediately. The value simply gets passed to the 
 * 										insertMultiple() method. Options are:
 * 										<ul>
 * 											<li><b> TimelineLite.ALIGN_SEQUENCE:</b> aligns the tweens one-after-the-other in a sequence
 * 											<li><b> TimelineLite.ALIGN_START:</b> aligns the start times of all of the tweens (ignores delays)
 * 											<li><b> TimelineLite.ALIGN_INIT:</b> aligns the start times of all the tweens (honors delays)
 * 										</ul>
 * 										The default is ALIGN_INIT.
 * 										
 * 	<li><b> stagger : Number</b>		Only used in conjunction with the "tweens" special property when multiple tweens are
 * 										to be inserted immediately. It staggers the tweens by a set amount of time (in seconds) (or
 * 										in frames if "useFrames" is true). For example, if the stagger value is 0.5 and the "align" 
 * 										property is set to ALIGN_START, the second tween will start 0.5 seconds after the first one 
 * 										starts, then 0.5 seconds later the third one will start, etc. If the align property is 
 * 										ALIGN_SEQUENCE, there would be 0.5 seconds added between each tween. This value simply gets 
 * 										passed to the insertMultiple() method. Default is 0.
 * 									
 * 	<li><b> tweenClass : Class</b>		Only used in conjunction with the "tweens" special property when multiple tweens are
 * 										to be inserted immediately and you're using the shorthand syntax for the tweens in the
 * 										Array (like <code>[mc, 1, {x:100}]</code> instead of <code>new TweenMax(mc, 1, {x:100})</code>). The parsed 
 * 										tweens must be either TweenLite or TweenMax tweens. The "tweenClass" property allows you
 * 										to specify which you prefer. Choices are either TweenLite or TweenMax. TweenLite is the default.
 * 										The only time you need to specify TweenMax is if you require special features that are only
 * 										available in TweenMax like repeat, pause/resume, etc. Make sure you pass the actual class, 
 * 										NOT a String. <br /><br />
 * 											
 * 											<b>BAD:</b>  <code>new TimelineLite({tweens:[[mc, 1, {x:100}], [mc, 1, {y:100}]], tweenClass:"TweenMax"});</code><br />
 * 											<b>GOOD:</b> <code>new TimelineLite({tweens:[[mc, 1, {x:100}], [mc, 1, {y:100}]], tweenClass:TweenMax});</code><br />
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onStart : Function</b>		A function that should be called when the timeline begins (the "progress" won't necessarily
 * 										be zero when onStart is called. For example, if the timeline is created and then its "progress"
 * 										property is immediately set to 0.5 or if its "time" property is set to something other than zero,
 * 										onStart will still get fired because it is the first time the timeline is getting rendered.)
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onStartParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onStart function.
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onUpdate : Function</b>		A function that should be called every time the timeline's time/position is updated 
 * 										(on every frame while the timeline is active)
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onUpdateParams : Array</b>	An Array of parameters to pass the onUpdate function
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onComplete : Function</b>	A function that should be called when the timeline has finished 
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onComplete function
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onReverseComplete : Function</b> A function that should be called when the timeline has reached its starting point again after having been reversed 
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> onReverseCompleteParams : Array</b> An Array of parameters to pass the onReverseComplete functions
 * 	
 * 	<li><b> autoRemoveChildren : Boolean</b> If autoRemoveChildren is set to true, as soon as child tweens/timelines complete,
 * 										they will automatically get killed/removed. This is normally undesireable because
 * 										it prevents going backwards in time (like if you want to reverse() or set the 
 * 										"progress" value to a lower value, etc.). It can, however, improve speed and memory
 * 										management. TweenLite's root timelines use autoRemoveChildren:true.
 * 	</ul>
 * 	
 * <b>NOTES:</b>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li> TimelineLite automatically inits the OverwriteManager class to prevent unexpected overwriting behavior in sequences.
 * 	  The default mode is AUTO, but you can set it to whatever you want with OverwriteManager.init() (see http://blog.greensock.com/overwritemanager/)
 * 	<li> TimelineLite adds about 2.9k to your SWF (3.5kb including OverwriteManager).

		 * Inserts multiple tweens, timelines, and/or callbacks into the timeline at once, optionally aligning them (as a sequence for example)

		 * advanced timing effects, parses shorthand syntax (like "[mc, 1, {x:100}]" instead of "new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:100})"),
		 * and builds complex sequences with relatively little code.<br /><br />
		 * 
		 * Shorthand syntax parsing:
		 * <ul>
		 * 		<li>Arrays become TweenLite instances (or TweenMax if that's what you define as the $TweenClass) - Each Array must have 3 elements that correspond to the ones normally passed in to the TweenLite or TweenMax constructor. So <code>[mc, 1, {x:0, alpha:0.5}]</code> becomes <code>new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:0, alpha:0.5})</code>
		 * 		<li>Functions become callbacks
		 * 		<li>Objects become TimelineLite instances</li> - <code>{tweens[tween1, tween2], stagger:0.2}</code> becomes <code>new TimelineLite({tweens[tween1, tween2], stagger:0.2});</code>
		 * </ul>
		 * 
		 * For example:<br /><br /><code>
		 * 
		 * myTimeline.insertMultiple([ <br />
		 * 							  myTween, //normal tweens are simply inserted <br />
		 * 							  [mc, 1, {x:0, alpha:0.5}], //parsed as: new TweenLite(mc, 1, {x:0, alpha:0.5}) <br />
		 * 							  {tweens:[tween1, tween2], stagger:0.2}, //parsed as a nested timeline: new TimelineLite({tweens:[tween1, tween2], stagger:0.2}) <br />
		 * 							  myFunction //Functions are parsed as callbacks <br />
		 * 							 ]);<br /><br />
		 *

		 * @param $timeOrLabel time in seconds (or frame if the timeline is frames-based) or label that serves as the point of insertion. For example, the number 2 would insert the tweens beginning at 2-seconds into the timeline, or "myLabel" would ihsert them wherever "myLabel" is.
		 * @param $align determines how the tweens will be aligned in relation to each other before getting inserted. Options are: TimelineLite.ALIGN_SEQUENCE (aligns the tweens one-after-the-other in a sequence), TimelineLite.ALIGN_START (aligns the start times of all of the tweens (ignores delays)), and TimelineLite.ALIGN_INIT (aligns the start times of all the tweens (honors delays)). The default is ALIGN_INIT.
		 * @param $stagger staggers the tweens by a set amount of time (in seconds) (or in frames for frames-based timelines). For example, if the stagger value is 0.5 and the "align" property is set to ALIGN_START, the second tween will start 0.5 seconds after the first one starts, then 0.5 seconds later the third one will start, etc. If the align property is ALIGN_SEQUENCE, there would be 0.5 seconds added between each tween. Default is 0.
