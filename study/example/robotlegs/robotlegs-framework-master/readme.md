# NOTE

Robotlegs 2 is currently in Beta. You can download the Robotlegs 1 release from: http://www.robotlegs.org/

The source for Robotlegs 1 can be found in the version1 branch:

# Robotlegs

Robotlegs is an ActionScript application framework for Flash and Flex. It offers:

+ Dependency management
+ Module management
+ Command management
+ View management
+ Plug-and-play extensions

# Quickstart

## Creating A Context

To create a Robotlegs application or module you need to instantiate a Context. A context won't do much without some configuration.

Plain ActionScript:

    _context = new Context()
        .install(MVCSBundle)
        .configure(MyAppConfig, SomeOtherConfig)
        .configure(new ContextView(this));

We install the MVCSBundle, which in turn installs a number of commonly used Extensions. We then add some custom application configurations.

We pass the instance "this" through as the "contextView" which is required by many of the view related extensions. It must be installed after the bundle or it won't be processed. Also, it should be added as the final configuration as it may trigger context initialization.

Note: You must hold on to the context instance or it will be garbage collected.

Flex:

    <fx:Declarations>
        <rl2:ContextBuilder>
            <mvcs:MVCSBundle/>
            <config:MyAppConfig/>
        </rl2:ContextBuilder>
    </fx:Declarations>

Note: In Flex we don't need to manually provide a "contextView" as the builder can determine this automatically.

## Application & Module Configuration

A simple application configuration file might look something like this:

    public class MyAppConfig implements IConfig
    {
        [Inject]
        public var injector:Injector;

        [Inject]
        public var mediatorMap:IMediatorMap;

        [Inject]
        public var commandMap:IEventCommandMap;

        [Inject]
        public var contextView:ContextView;

        public function configure():void
        {
            injector.map(UserModel).asSingleton();

            mediatorMap.map(UserProfileView).toMediator(UserProfileMediator);

            commandMap.map(UserEvent.SIGN_IN).toCommand(UserSignInCommand);

            // The "view" property is a DisplayObjectContainer reference.
            // If this was a Flex application we would need to cast it
            // as an IVisualElementContainer and call addElement().
            contextView.view.addChild(new MainView());
        }
    }

The configuration file above implements IConfig. An instance of this class will be created automatically when the context initializes.

We Inject the utilities that we want to configure, and add our Main View to the Context View.

### An Example Mediator

The mediator we mapped above might look like this:

    public class UserProfileMediator extends Mediator
    {
        [Inject]
        public var view:UserProfileView;

        override public function initialize():void
        {
            // Redispatch the event to the framework
            addViewListener(UserEvent.SIGN_IN, dispatch);
        }
    }

The view that caused this mediator to be created is available for Injection.

For more info see: robotlegs.bender.extensions.mediatorMap.readme

### An Example Command

The command we mapped above might look like this:

    public class UserSignInCommand extends Command
    {
        [Inject]
        public var event:UserEvent;

        [Inject]
        public var model:UserModel;

        override public function execute():void
        {
            if (event.username == "bob")
                model.signedIn = true;
        }
    }

The event that triggered this command is available for Injection.

# Robotlegs 2 - What's New?

Robotlegs 2 is a complete rewrite of the Robotlegs framework. It features:

+ Better configuration
+ Better extension
+ Better module support
+ Flexible type matching

# Building and Running the Tests

## Requirements

Whilst Robotlegs can be used for Flex 3 & 4 and plain ActionScript projects, the library must be built with the Flex 4.6 SDK or above.

## Building with ANT

Copy the "user.properties.eg" file to "user.properties" and edit it to point to your local Flex SDK. Then run:

ant package

## Building with Maven

See: Maven-README

## Building with Buildr on OSX

- Install XCode 3 or 4
- check RubyGems version
    
    $ gem -v
    1.8.1
    
- update RubyGems if version is less than 1.3.6

    $ sudo gem update --system
    
- install Bundler

    $ sudo gem install bundler
    
- run Bundler to install dependencies

    $ bundle install
    
- run Buildr to build RobotLegs & run Tests

    $ bundle exec buildr test
    
- open test report

    $ open reports/flexunit4/html/index.html
